# Ales Light Sensor Document Filter

This project was built to help a **Cisco electrical engineering employee** streamline their workflow by extracting product-specific information from a large Word document and automatically generating a new, clean document with only the relevant product data.

I developed this tool **entirely on my own** by watching YouTube tutorials, exploring Python libraries, and applying what I learned to solve a real-world need. This is a self-taught project that demonstrates both initiative and practical problem-solving.

## What It Does

Given a master `.docx` file with information about multiple products, the script:

- Prompts the user to input a product number
- Parses the Word document to isolate only the relevant product content
- Generates a new Word document with just that productâ€™s information
- Saves the output in a clean format inside the `output/` folder

This solution is especially helpful for engineers or teams who frequently need to extract and send product-specific documentation.
